    <h1>Hello I'm Anel</h1>
    <h2>Welcome to my Site</h2>
    <h3>pronouns: she/her</h3> 
    <p>I am in my fourth year at CU Boulder studying Media Production and double minoring in CTD and Leadership Studies.
            Documentary media is where my heart lies, I hope to share people's stories and provide new perspectives of life 
        for others. </p>
    <sub style="font-family:Helvetica;">I also hope to learn how to make a nicer looking website to use as a portfolio through this course</sub>
