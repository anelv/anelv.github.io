        <hr>

        <p>I am in my fourth year at CU Boulder studying Media Production and double minoring in CTD and Leadership Studies. 
          Throughout my time at the university I have had the great opportunity to not only learn so much about the world,
          but also about myself.</p>
        <p> Documentary media is where my heart lies, I hope to share people's stories and provide new perspectives of life 
          for others to allow others to better understand different experiences. I've taken many classes that contribute to my love and 
          skills in media making over my three years in my major and CTD minor, and I always look for ways to apply them into my documentary media. </p>
