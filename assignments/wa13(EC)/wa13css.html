        <div id="shortBio">
            <p>I am a Teaching Assistant Professor in the ATLAS Institute at the University of Colorado Boulder. 
                I completed my PhD in Information Science, also at CU Boulder, working with Jed Brubaker and the Identity Lab.
                 My research interests focus on understanding the experiences people have during life transitions and how those experiences are 
                 represented in sociotechnical systems. I am particularly interested in how people make decisions about the data 
                 that are left behind in the wake of a romantic relationship ending, and how those decisions contribute to the formation of post-break-up identities.
            </p>
            <p>I am concurrently an Adjunct Part-Time Faculty member in Penn State's College of Information Sciences and Technology,
                 where I have taught through Penn State's World Campus program since 2016.
