        <p>Throughout my senior year I will continue to work towards my honors project which will be presented as a short documentary film.</p>
        <p>Thesis: We are living in a digital era where most of us confide in the extensive amounts of resources provided by technology to gather 
            information and communicate with the rest of society. Technology makes it easy to find information, save time, make money, and learn new 
            techniques that are being required by higher paying jobs. The efficiency of technology has led to the digitization of countless occupations. 
            With this, we can see how the media and entertainment industry continues to grow rapidly as more and more people connect to the internet, 
            allowing them to network and find greater opportunities than ever before. Unfortunately these opportunities are not accessible to everyone.
            I will be exploring the role of technology for first generation Chicanx families who are falling behind because of this new form of oppression.
