        <hr>

        <p>Throughout my senior year I will continue to work towards my honors project which will be presented as a short documentary film.
            I've have the opportunity to work with Sister Carmen Community Center, specifically with the Bridging the Digital Divide Program, which provides 
            a basic computer class and affordable laptops for its participants. I attended their 8 week course to assist, observe, and film the community 
            created by the instructor's genuine engagement with students. The experience was empowering for us all, which I hope to exemplify through 
            my visual representations of the classes. 
        </p>
        <h4> Project Thesis: </h4>
        <p class="thesis"> We are living in a digital era where most of us confide in the extensive amounts of resources provided by technology to gather 
            information and communicate with the rest of society. Technology makes it easy to find information, save time, make money, and learn new 
            techniques that are being required by higher paying jobs. The efficiency of technology has led to the digitization of countless occupations. 
            With this, we can see how the media and entertainment industry continues to grow rapidly as more and more people connect to the internet, 
            allowing them to network and find greater opportunities than ever before. Unfortunately these opportunities are not accessible to everyone.
            I will be exploring the role of technology for first generation Chicanx families who are falling behind because of this new form of oppression towards underrepresented and marginalized groups.

        <p class="thanks">
            With Sister Carmen we have been helping people in the community who donâ€™t have the knowledge or finances to acquire and learn about technology,
             and highlighting how this issue separates a certain demographic of people and affects their lives. 
        </p>
        <p class="thanks">    
             Thank you to Lara Van Matre and Julie Piller for allowing us to observe and work with you and the Sister Camren organization. 
             We appreciate the opportunity you gave us to participate and witness the great impacts of empowering leadership during our short time with Sister Carmen.
        </p>
