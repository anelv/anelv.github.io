                <p>Going to college is not an option for many students, particularly those who belong to the minority groups that do not have the same privilege and opportunities to 
                    seek higher education as those in wealthier communities. The Pre-Collegiate Development Program (PCDP) at CU Boulder has provided minority students and their families
                     with the resources and support they need to seek a successful future through a university education for nearly 40 years, and have continued 
                     to build a strong community full of diversity here at a predominantly white institution. This community has become a place of security for its student staff 
                     and the families trying to be a part of the university, permitting a space for one to understand and aid one another through issues of finances, language barriers, and more.

                    <p> This film was my final documentary for CMDP 3800.
                        It was my first experience collaborating with many people who I work with for a video production. I worked with my boss regarding 
                        the use of our office workplace coming back from Fall break, and set up some interviews and days to film there. I did/do spend a lot of time there, 
                         but I had to make sure to schedule equipment reservations ahead of time for filmming days. During filming I had the camera roll on presets that will work with the 
                         lighting to use as b-roll footage. </p>

                    <p> I planned to film the interview with a student and parent involved with 
                         the program while I was on break, and ended up using my mom and younger sister as the subjects because of my busy schedule. 
                         This allowed me to begin editing while on break, and be ready to insert the b-roll footage of the PCDP office and interviews 
                         with the staff. I made sure to get all of the footage in the office space completed by December 2nd so I could 
                         spend the time back from break editing the rest of the footage together. </p>
                    <p> I did end up rushing the editing proccess since I had had many difficulties working with my grainy footage and loads of information
                        from interviews, which is always my downfall since I cannot always include everything I would like in the final product. Still, 
                        this is a film I am proud of because of the visiibility it brings to our important roles at this university.</p>

                <h6>About the process</h6>
                <p> This 'doc mark' was one of five 2-4 minute short documentary project assignments for my Engaged Documentary Media class
                    last spring, where we did a lot more hands on work to better understand the production side of filmmaking and how it 
                    can further carry a narrative on its own. </p>
                <p>I made this video in about a week and a half, using a digital camera from the media equipment center on campus, as well as a 
                    nice and hefty manfrotto tripod. I used an H6 audio recorder to record my voice and editted all of the footage on adobe premier pro.</p>
                <p> This project made has been one of the most fulliling for me, not only because the final clip is my partner asking me to be their girlfriend
                    by surprise, but because the emotional toll of reviving homophobic experiences is draining, but documentary yet again allowed me to process
                    my experiences and create a brighter conclusion. </p>

                <p>As a first-generation Mexican American woman of color at a predominantly white institution, I stand out, and it is not always for 
                    what feel to be the best reasons. To add on top of this, I present as openly queer, something that has been brought to my attention 
                by peers, as if I wasn't aware of who I am or how I express myself. Unfortunately, some comments are often hateful, and the stares or 
                prejudices can become overwhelming, but we must always remember how fulliling it can be to be true to ourselves and be grateful for those
                who love us for who we are. </p>

                <p>Everything we know in life comes from those who raise us, and as we grow up we come to learn how certain ideas and morals of theirs were 
                    introduced in their lives. Sometimes those who try to protect us from the world as we grow, are the ones who end up doing the most damage, 
                    often carrying unhealed traumas into the way they manage their relationships. Father of four girls, my dad has caused a lot of damage through 
                    his toxic masculinity that has asserted his dominance over us all and is now in the process of learning how to communicate better with us as we 
                    finally make our voices heard.

                    <h6>About the process</h6>
                    <p> The production of this film has had to be the most draining for me, as my relationship with my family has always been at a weird place,
                        but I was able to use this assignment as an excuse to ask everyone to open up to me, and more importantly, to one another. </p>
                    <p> By this time I had learned what equipment would serve me better for a longer length short film, and all the practice using lighting, audio, and camera
                        equipment in class definitely made things feel more real. I set up five different interviews using the bare-minnimum set of equipment for a decent 
                        film production, and did it almost all by myself. Of course, I had to ask my sisters to help me with keeping track of the audio while I filmed and asked
                        interview quiestions, and they would always help me clean up the whole set afterwards too.      
                         </p>
                    <p> I had the chance to explore observational and archival modes of documentary while also participating in the film myself. </p>

                <h6>About the process</h6>
                <p> This has been my first documentary project this semester, and it consists soley of found footage and archival material. </p>
                <p> The assignment required us to follow the style of documentary from one of the five films we'd been required to watch, I took 
                    inspiration from the feature lenght film "LA 92" which is made from archival videos from the LA riots in 1992 which expose police brutality 
                    against African-Americans. </p>
                <p>
                    I took this opportunity to shed some light on the significance of Gay Pride marches throughout history by conjuring up footage from
                    anti-gay propaganda, news media coverage on the LGBTQ+ community, and archival footage of pride parades. </p>

                <p>Gay Pride is bigger than ever before, but it is important to look back at how we got here, since the country has not always been
                    very inclusive of the community, and still have the ability to misrepresent us in media today. </p>
