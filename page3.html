            <p> The effective use of sound requires intelligibility in recordings of the 
              human voice as well as a creative exploration of how reality can be communicated to audiences beyond what's spoken. <p> 
            <p>When considering the life of audio in films, one has to ask themselves: Will your project remain exclusively in a realistic sound design or will 
              there be moments of subjective or expressionistic sound? Will your documentary use music and if so, how? </p>
              <p> These questions open up a world that we can explore simply through the power of listening and hearing sounds. One thing I will always remember from 
                my classes in media practices is that a video with good audio and poor visuals will always be more well recieved than one with poor audio and decent visuals.

                    <p> This audio was my final project for Sound and Technology, in which I applied as much content and techniques of capturing and editing sounds
                      I gained from the class to create a rhythmic exploration of radio interferences and live recorded music. </p>
                    <p> I captured most of the audio for this project myself, using a handheld radio for the static noise and live stations, and an H6 audio recorder
                      to record me playing a few of my favorite songs on the guitar. I did, however, download the actual songs to give the effect that they
                      were being played on the radio but were constantly intterupted by my own acoustic covers.

              <p> This was an audio project for my Creative Media Making class, where I pushed myself to talk to strangers at Union Station, capturing some interesting interactions. </p>
              <p> All of the audio used in this project was captured in one night using the same old H6 recorder and an NGT-2 microphone. I edited the sounds in a manner that would
                tell a story in a kind of immersive way. Here I employed my narration as a way to provide some context for the responses my subjects provided, without including very much of my 
                actual presence in the space. </p>
              <p> The project was inspired by the format of the Phantom Power podcasts.</p>

      <h2>Photography & Design</h2> 
      <p class="p-d"> Making strong preparatory choices about how to frame and light shots as well as deciding whether the camera will be on a tripod or handheld is vital
        to producing effective visual work.<p> 
        <p class="p-d">Learning how to operate a camera has been a process that I am still navigating today as I continue to explore and try out different gear out of mere curiosity.
          Over time I have also had the opportunity to aquire my own video camera and a digital photo camera, and even though they're not of the greatest quality, they 
        provide depictions of real life. Understranding the various components of these devices can only be beneficial as we attempt to capture the right moments in the 
      best frames possible. As a photographer and/or cinematographer, we are in control of shooting formats, lighting, shot size, camera placement, and so much more. </p>

                    <p>This multi-page publication depicts how close people are to the ones they call â€œbest friends" 
                      or partners in life. I observe the dynamics in relationships of people I am close to, capturing their mannerisms
                       with one another, and the range of emotions they experience together. The book is categorized by age groups and the 
                       type of relationship (best friends, coworkers, classmates, married couples, etc.) as I have noticed differences 
                       in how relationships of varying generations and labels have different ideas of what it means to show affection.

                    <p>The design element of the spreads was led by the desire to see these images speak to one abother, both through structure and through content. </p>

              <p>As artists, we use mediums that help us communicate and express ourselves with the rest of the world. We become one with our instruments, 
                and the art that comes out of how we use these outlets becomes a reflection of ourselves as we have immersed ourselves in the creative process, 
                our collections are continually expanding as we grow as artists and continue to create. </p>
              <p> All of the images in this project are photographs I took of my friends and what I liked to call, "their tools for expression" surrounding or immersing them. 
                Unfortunately, I only have one example here because the other images were not saved as spreads, but I hope to update this site.
